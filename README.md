# Edge of AI: Azure Manufacturing Vision Accelerator (Linux, ARM64)
This is a public repo for the AIoT Manufacturing Vision Accelerator, created by myself and Nick Kwiecien, Ph.D. from Microsoft, aided my many contributors along the way. The source code is posted here as an early access version, but the full version of the solution will be available very soon, including full documentation and MLOps/DevOps pipelines.

If you would like to leverage this repository prior to the release of the full version, please reach out to me at jocoons@microsoft.com for assistance.
